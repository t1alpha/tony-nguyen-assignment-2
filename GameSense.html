                <h2>Enemy Tracking</h2>
                <p>
                    You want to know where all your enemies are, obviously if you know where they are, it's a lot easier to kill them.
                    Generally the default set up is 2 on left side of map , 2 on right side of map , and 1 in middle of map.
                    This is the default positions you want to assume you enemies are. Making sure to count everyone you see will
                    be benefically in planning what to do. More than 2 enemies at a given area, the enemy is aware that you are
                    there, so best to rotate or look for a pick. Make sure you're looking at your radar to find where enemies are.
                </p>

                <h2>Playing to win</h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to rank up, you must play to win rounds, not KDA. Think about your win conditions. It's a team game,
                    so work together with your team rather than going off on your own. Prioritize winning rounds not kills, for example
                    on attack side, your win conditions are killing all enemies or planting the bomb and blowing it up. If you can't kill
                    the enemies you have to rely on the bomb, Prioritize that rather than trying to go for the kill and risking death.
                </p>

            <div class="col">
                <h2>Abilitie counting</h2>
                <p>
                    Always check enemy ultimates, and consider your gameplan from there. If the enemy has AOE ultimate, don't group up.
                    If the enemy has single target ultimate, take them down as a team. This applies for normal abilities as well,
                    a character has a certain amount of charges per ability, you can take advantage of these windows in which they
                    are unable to utilize their abilities.
